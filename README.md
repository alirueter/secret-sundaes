# Social Network Api

## Description
This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend ist. Express.js was used for routing, MongoDB was used for the database, and Mongoose was used as the ODM.

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine and install the dependencies. Then run server.js.

## Usage
This is only the backend for the appliction, so the API calls need to be made using Insomnia Core or a tool similar. The API lets you POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE users, and user thoughts.You can also POST and DELETE to add or remove a user from another user's friends list as well as POST and DELETE to add or remove reactions to a user's posted thoughts.
